/*
 * calendar.js — a tiny, pure-JS resolver for the modern General Roman Calendar.
 *
 * PLAN.md originally proposed precomputing a calendar with `romcal` at build
 * time, but this machine has no Node toolchain, so the calendar is computed in
 * the browser instead. Everything sits behind one function, `RESOLVE_DAY`, so a
 * romcal-generated lookup table or a 1962-Missal backend can replace the guts
 * later without touching the rest of the app.
 *
 *   window.RESOLVE_DAY(date) -> {
 *     date,        // "YYYY-MM-DD"
 *     title,       // human label, e.g. "11th Sunday in Ordinary Time"
 *     season,      // advent | christmas | ordinary | lent | easter
 *     color,       // violet | white | green | rose | red | black
 *     rank,        // Solemnity | Feast | Sunday | Feria
 *     isSunday,
 *     dayKey,      // proper-of-the-day key (named feasts + Sundays), or null
 *     sundayKey,   // key of the Sunday governing this week (for ferial fallback)
 *     seasonKey    // season-level fallback key
 *   }
 *
 * The KEYS it emits (e.g. "rorate", "laetare", "ot-11") are the same keys used
 * in data/introits.js. The resolver itself knows nothing about which introits
 * are authored — app.js does the lookup + fallback against INTROITS.
 *
 * V1 simplifications (documented so the gaps are intentional, not bugs):
 *   - Epiphany is fixed to Jan 6 (not transferred to a Sunday).
 *   - Ascension stays on Thursday; Corpus Christi is the Sunday (US usage).
 *
 * Sanctoral precedence (the fixed feasts the Diocese of La Crosse lists):
 *   Fixed/sanctoral feasts override Ordinary-Time Sundays and every ferial day.
 *   They do NOT override the Sundays of Advent, Lent, or Easter, the Triduum, or
 *   the marquee movable solemnities. When a feast is impeded by one of those it is
 *   simply not shown — there is no automatic transferral (a documented V2 gap). A
 *   couple of days carry more than one Mass on the same date (Christmas: Midnight /
 *   Dawn / Day; the Assumption: two options); those expose an `options` array and
 *   the app lets the reader switch between them.
